Revision history for Perl extension Search::HiLiter.

0.01  Thu Jun 22 08:06:59 2006
	- original version

0.02
    * added example/ scripts
    * fixed S::T::K SYNOPSIS to reflect reality
    * POD fixes
    * added is_valid_utf8() method to S::T::Transliterate
      along with valid utf8 check in convert()
    * rewrote S::T::Keywords logic to:
        * correctly parse stopwords (all are compared with lc())
        * return phrases as phrases
        * additional UTF-8 checks
        * parse according to RegExp character definitions
    * changed default UTF8Char regexp in S::T::RegExp
    * changed default WordChar regexp in S::T::RegExp
    * begin_characters and end_characters are no longer supported
      since they were logically just the inverse of ignore_*_char plus
      word_characters. The entire regexp construction was refactored
      with that in mind.
    * @Search::Tools::Accessors now provides (saner) way for subclasses
      to inherit attributes like word_characters, stemmer, stopwords, etc.
    * S::T::RegExp kw_opts is no longer supported
    * stopwords are intentionally left in phrases, as are special boolean words
    * added ->phrase accessor to S::T::R::Keyword
    * S::T::HiLiter now higlights all phrases before singles so that
      any overlap privileges the phrase match. Example would be 'foo and "foo bar"'
      where the phrase "foo bar" should receive precedence over single word 'foo'.
      
0.03
    * fixed charset/locale issue in S::T::Keywords reported by Debbie Jones

0.04
    * added S::T::SpellCheck
    * fixed (finally I hope) charset/locale/lang issue by making it global
      accessor and checking for C and POSIX
    * reorged default settings in S::T::Keywords to set in new() rather
      than each time in extract()
   
0.05
    * added spellcheck() convenience method to S::T
    * added t/11synopsis.t test
    * changed POD to reflect new methods
    * added query() accessor to S::T::SpellCheck
    * thanks to Kezmega@sbcglobal.net for the above suggestions
    * fixed POD example in S::T::HiLiter
 
0.06
    * Kezmega@sbcglobal.net found a bug when running under -T taint mode.
      fixed in S::T::Keywords.
      
0.07
    * added more utf8 methods to S::T::Transliterate.
    * added $sane threshold to prevent segfaults when checking for valid_utf8 in
      long strings (like file slurps)
    * changed example/swish-e.pl to use SWISH::API::Object
    * fixed subtle regex bug with constructing word boundaries wrt ignore_*_chars
   
0.08
    * fixed bug with S::T::XML utf8_escape() with escaping a literal 0
    * changed required minimum perl to 5.8.3 for correct UTF-8 support.
    * kris@koehntopp.de suggested changes to the default character map in S::T::T
      to better support multiple transliteration options. This resulted in per-instance
      character map and no more package %Map. See doc in S::T::T for map() method.

0.09
    * separated the UTF8 checking into Search::Tools::UTF8 and use XS to check valid utf8.
      Among other things, fixes the string length bug on is_valid_utf8() 
      that previously segfaulted if the string was longer than 24K.

0.10
    * fix bug in Tools.xs where NULL was being returned as SV* instead of &PL_sv_undef

0.11
    * fix bug in UTF8.pm where latin1 was flagged internally as UTF-8 and so fooled the native
      Perl checks.
    * rewrite is_latin1() and find_bad_latin1() as XS.
    * refactored is_valid_utf8() to use internal Perl is_utf8_string() plus is_latin() and is_ascii()
      checks to help reduce ambiguity.
    * hardcode locale into some tests so that latin1 is not magically upgraded to utf8 by perl.

0.12
    * change tests to force locale for spelling dictionaries, or skip if not found

0.13
    * added File::Slurp to requirements, since tests use it.
    * changed 'use <version>' syntax to be portable.

0.14
    * fixed <version> in Makefile.PL

0.15
    * fix t/09locale.t to skip if UTF-8 charset not available via setlocale()

0.16  22 Nov 2007
    * refactor common object stuff into new Search::Tools::Object class
    * change behaviour of XML escape()/unescape() to return filtered values instead of in-place

0.17  22 May 2008
    * fix typos in S::T::SpellCheck
    * refactor some remaining classes to use Search::Tools::Object class

0.18  02 Dec 2008
    * add more debugging to to_utf8() function.
    * make Text::Aspell optional, since it has non-CPAN dependency

0.19  16 Dec 2008
    * more tests
    * clarify use of ebit in Transliterate docs

0.20  16 Dec 2008
    * refactor Transliterate->convert(). now 244% faster.

0.21  22 Jan 2009
    * fix bug in init of Transliterate map that was triggered when multiple instances
      are created in a single app

0.22  22 Jan 2009
    * continue fixing Transliterate bug exposed in version 0.20

0.23  17 July 2009
    * change utf8_safe() XML method to change low non-whitespace ascii chars to single space.
      This makes them XML-spec compliant.

0.24  19 Sept 2009
    * thanks to Henry at zen for prompting the bug fixes and improvements 
      in this release.
    * fix Data::Dump calls from pp() to fully-qualified.
    * Snipper->snip() will always return UTF-8 encoded text.
    * rename Snipper methods snipper_name, snipper_force and snipper_type 
      to type_used, force and type.
    * document Snipper->type().
    * fix some off-by-one errors in all the snip() algorithms
    * fix the debugging code in Snipper
    * add sanity check fallback to plain() hiliter to persevere if plain 
      regex obviously fails.
    * add ignore_fields feature
    * add treat_uris_like_phrases feature
    * RegExp, RegExp::Keywords, RegExp::Keyword and Keywords are all 
      deprecated in favor of the new, tidier and cleaner QueryParser, 
      Query and RegEx classes. Backwards compatibility is preserved
      for existing code, but users should move to the new API as 
      documented in Search::Tools.
      RegExp will carp every time you build() with it.
    * added new Tokenizer, Token and TokenList XS code for must faster snipping.
    * added PP versions of tokenizing code, both for benchmarking and 
      comparision.  As expected, XS is much faster. The extra speed makes it 
      possible to be more accurate in snippet extraction without sacrificing 
      performance.

0.25  19 Sept 2009
    * add missing $VERSION back to Keywords.pm to satisfy CPAN

0.26  23 Sept 2009
    * fix a couple of Perl::Critic warnings (trivial imo)
    * fix repos and homepage links in Makefile.PL
    * fix a couple of regex escape bugs in HiLiter
    * fix an innocuous bug in Object that passed extra args to 
      QueryParser->new in _normalize_args
    * add \002/\003 no-hiliting marker support in HiLiter 
      (for HTML::HiLiter)
    * HiLiter->light() now returned UTF-8 encoded text like 
      Snipper->snip() does.
    * fix regex build bug where phrase could be separated by multiple 
      whitespace chars.

0.27  29 Sept 2009
    * optimize XML->escape() and remove %XML::Ents as public variable.
      escape() is now in C/XS, borrowed from mod_perl.
    * add query_class() to QueryParser to allow subclassing Query

0.28  29 Sept 2009
    * add missing dTHX macro for 5.10 build.

0.29  11 Oct 2009
    * tweek snippet sorting to value higher unique term frequency.
    * add XML->strip_markup as alias for no_html()
    * added as_sentences experimental feature to Snipper and supporting classes.

0.30  13 Oct 2009
    * do not prefix ellipse to snippets in Snipper when as_sentences is true.
    * add attribute support to XML->start_tag().
    * bump Rose::ObjectX::CAF req version to catch bad param names and fix a couple.
    * fix as_sentences feature in HeatMap where $end offset was overrunning the tokens
      array length.

0.31  14 Oct 2009
    * add missing dTHX; macro to st_malloc per RT #50509

0.32  31 Oct 2009
    * fix mem leaks
    * optimize normalize_whitespace regex 

0.33  19 Nov 2009
    * switch default Snipper type to 'offset' to optimize for large target texts.
    * add Tokenizer->get_offsets() method in C/XS.
    * fix Snipper->show feature to work as the author expected it to. Do not return
      anything if no match.
    * refactor is_ascii C code and is_sentence_start() to return false if match on UPPER
      as opposed to Upper.

0.34  22 Nov 2009
    * make the bigfile test optional and make it use the 'offset' snipper to reduce mem use by 60%.

0.35  30 Nov 2009
    * add UTF::byte_length() function just like bytes::length()
    * some attempts to compile under Win32 (programming a bit blind with nothing to test on...)

0.36   3 Dec 2009
    * add FUNCTION__ definition for those Perls (<5.8.8) that lack it.

0.37   06 Dec 2009
    * fix blead perl REGEXP change for Perls >= 5.11. [r2330]

0.38   22 Jan 2010
    * add support for wildcard at start of term in addition to end of term.
    * added Windows-1252 (cp1252) encoding helpers.
    * added Encoding::FixLatin as a dependency.
    * fix off-by-one errors in find_bad_*_report and find_bad_* UTF8 functions.
    * add debug_bytes() to UTF8 class.

0.39   23 Jan 2010
    * switch from Search::QueryParser to Search::Query::Parser. This change
      means that some methods in Search::Tools::Query and Search::Tools::QueryParser
      were added, removed or modified. Please check the documentaiton.

0.40   31 Jan 2010
    * added ignore_length() feature to Snipper.
    * added treat_phrases_as_singles() feature to Snipper.

0.41   01 Feb 2010
    * move SWISH::Prog::Utils perl_to_xml() feature to Search::Tools::XML.

0.42   03 Feb 2010
    * fix bug in XML->tag_safe that disallowed XML namespaces.
    * add XML->tidy method.

0.43   06 Feb 2010
    * fix bug with Search::Query::Parser method name (error() not err()).
    * fix doc bug in Snipper.
    * refactor QueryParser internals to work with latest Search::Query 0.07.

0.44   24 Feb 2010
    * fix locale test case comparison for UTF-8 (RT#54941 reported by John Napiorkowski)

0.45   04 March 2010
    * change QueryParser tests for range to use native dialect, not SWISH.

0.46   06 April 2010
    * fix croak message for debug-level sanity check on text match in HiLiter.
    * fix bugs with as_sentences for checking end boundaries.

0.47   16 April 2010
    * fix regex bug in Transliterate->convert where newlines were being skipped.

0.48   30 April 2010
    * fix treat_phrases_as_singles bug in Snipper where phrases were never being matched.
    * compromise on proximity query syntax ("foo bar"~10) by always treating as single terms.

0.49   08 May 2010
    * change from FUNCTION__ to __func__ in all .c code.

0.50   19 May 2010
    * fix default regex for QueryParser->term_re and Tokenizer->re to match default
      QueryParser->word_characters. The chief difference is that now the hyphen "-" is
      considered a word character if it appears like a single quote does. So this:
         don't think twice it's all-right
      is now 5 tokens instead of 6.

0.51   23 May 2010
    * singularizer in XML->perl_to_xml will now treat common English plurals

0.52   22 June 2010
    * tweek locale tests because some OSes (linux) use 'UTF8' instead of 'UTF-8' naming.
    * small optimizations to HiLiter

0.53   26 June 2010
    * add ->matches_text and ->matches_html methods to Query class

0.54   24 Oct 2010
    * fixes for Search::Query 0.18
    * disabled some tests that break under perl >= 5.14. 
      See https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=62417

0.55   25 Oct 2010
    * disable one more test for perl >= 5.14 (see 0.54)

0.56   10 Feb 2011
    * fix bug where query terms 'span' or 'style' were breaking hiliting by "double-dipping"

0.57   22 Feb 2011
    * extend bug-fix from 0.56 to prevent false matches on match markers.

0.58   27 May 2011
    * fix unescaped string in regex in HiLiter

0.59   19 June 2011
    * add normalize_whitespace feature to XML->no_html() method.
    * add several Unicode whitespace defs to $whitespace regex in XML class
      per http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mapping_of_Unicode_characters

0.60  13 July 2011
    * fix whitespace def to include &nbsp; (broke HTML::HiLiter)

0.61  29 July 2011
    * add term_min_length option to QueryParser, to ignore terms unless then are
      N chars or longer. Useful for skipping single-character words when Snipping
      or HiLiting. For backwards compatibility the default is 1.
    * fix treat_uris_like_phrases regex to add / character in addition to @.\

0.62  26 Aug 2011
    * remove ';' as sentence boundary character (it was marked as TODO in search-tools.c)
      because character entities use it (e.g. &amp;).

0.63  06 Oct 2011
    * change __func__ macro to use FUNCION__ instead since Perl core implements
      that portable macro.

0.64  02 Dec 2011
    * optimizations to regex matching in Query->matches and HiLiter
    * according to Unicode spect \xfeff (BOM) is deprecated as whitespace character
      in favor of \x2060. HTML whitespace definition changed accordingly.
    * fix edge case in HiLiter where match on single letter could cause infinite loop.
    * add Query->fields method to see the fields searched for.
    * fix XML->unescape_named to support entities with \d in them, and case-insensitive.
      https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=72904

0.65  02 Dec 2011
    * lowercase named entity matches. patch from Adam Lesperance.

0.66  05 Dec 2011
    * undo 0.65 change, since HTML entities are case sensitive (http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/charset.html#h-5.3.2)

0.67  12 Jan 2012
    * bolster Tokenizer sentence detection, adding list of abbreviations from Linga::EN::Tagger.
    * fix missing 'lang' param for SpellCheck
    * fix placement of dSP macro in tokenize() C func to properly scope stack variables.
    * add slurp() method to Search::Tools

0.68  15 Jan 2012
    * add missing dTHX macro per https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=74022
