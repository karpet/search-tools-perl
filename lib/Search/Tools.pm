=head1 NAME

Search::Tools - high-performance tools for building search applications

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Search::Tools;
 
 my $string     = 'the quik brown fox';
 my $qparser    = Search::Tools->parser();
 my $query      = $qparser->parse($string);
 my $snipper    = Search::Tools->snipper(query => $query);
 my $hiliter    = Search::Tools->hiliter(query => $query);
 my $spellcheck = Search::Tools->spellcheck(query_parser => $qparser);

 my $suggestions = $spellcheck->suggest($string);
 
 for my $s (@$suggestions) {
    if (! $s->{suggestions}) {
        # $s->{word} was spelled correctly
    }
    elsif (@{ $s->{suggestions} }) {
        printf "Did you mean: %s\n", join(' or ', @{$s->{suggestions}}));
    }
 }

 for my $result (@search_results) {
    print $hiliter->light( $snipper->snip( $result->summary ) );
 }
  
 
=head1 DESCRIPTION

Search::Tools is a set of utilities for building search applications.
Rather than adhering to a particular search application or framework,
the goal of Search::Tools is to provide general-purpose methods for common
search application features. Think of Search::Tools like a toolbox
rather than a hammer.

Examples include:

=over

=item

Parsing search queries for the meaningful terms

=item

Rich regular expressions for locating terms in the original
indexed documents

=item

Contextual snippets showing query terms

=item

Highlighting of terms in context

=item

Spell check terms and suggestions of alternate spellings.

=back

Search::Tools is derived from some of the features in HTML::HiLiter
and SWISH::HiLiter, but has been re-written with an eye to accomodating
more general purpose features.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 parser( I<args> )

Returns a Search::Tools::Parser object, passing I<args> to new().

=head2 regexp

Deprecated. Use parser() instead.

=head2 hiliter( I<args> )

Returns a Search::Tools::HiLiter object, passing I<args> to new().

=head2 snipper( I<args> )

Returns a Search::Tools::Snipper object, passing I<args> to new().

=head2 transliterate( I<str> )

Same as:

 Search::Tools::Transliterate->new()->convert( $str )

=head2 spellcheck( I<args> )

Returns a Search::Tools::SpellCheck object, passing I<args> to new().

=head2 slurp( I<filename> )

Reads contents of I<filename> into a scalar variable. Similar to File::Slurp,
but will handle compressed files (.gz or .bz2) transparently
using IO::Uncompress.

=cut

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 describe( I<object> )

XS debugging help. Same as using Devel::Peek.

=head1 REQUIREMENTS

Perl 5.8.3 or later is required. This is for full UTF-8 support.

The following non-core CPAN modules are required:

=over

=item Class::XSAccessor

=item Search::Query

=item Data::Dump

=item Encode

=item Encoding::FixLatin

=item Carp

=back

The following CPAN modules are recommended for the full set of features
and for performance.

=over

=item Text::Aspell

=back

See also the specific module documentation for individual requirements.

=head1 HISTORY

The public API has changed as of version 0.24. The following classes
are now removed:

 Search::Tools::Keywords
 Search::Tools::RegExp
 Search::Tools::RegExp::Keywords
 Search::Tools::RegExp::Keyword

The following Search::Tools method is deprecated:

 regexp()

The following classes are new as of version 0.24:

 Search::Tools::HeatMap
 Search::Tools::Query
 Search::Tools::QueryParser
 Search::Tools::RegEx
 Search::Tools::Token
 Search::Tools::TokenList
 Search::Tools::TokenListPP
 Search::Tools::TokenListUtils
 Search::Tools::TokenPP
 Search::Tools::Tokenizer

=head1 EXAMPLES

See the tests in t/ and the example scripts in example/.
