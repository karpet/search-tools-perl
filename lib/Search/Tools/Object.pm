=head1 NAME

Search::Tools::Object - base class for Search::Tools objects

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 package MyClass;
 use base qw( Search::Tools::Object );
 
 __PACKAGE__->mk_accessors( qw( foo bar ) );
 
 sub init {
    my $self = shift;
    $self->SUPER::init(@_);

    # do stuff to set up object
    
 }
 
 1;
 
 # elsewhere
 
 use MyClass;
 my $object = MyClass->new;
 $object->foo(123);
 print $object->bar . "\n";

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Search::Tools::Object is a subclass of Rose::Object. Prior to version 0.24
STO was a subclass of Class::Accessor::Fast. Backwards compatability for
the mk_accessors() and mk_ro_accessors() class methods are preserved
via Search::Tools::MethodMaker.

=head1 METHODS

=cut

sub _init {
    croak "use init() instead";
}

=head2 init

Overrides base Rose::Object method. Rather than calling
the method name for each param passed in new(), the value
is simply set in the object as a hash ref. This assumes
every Search::Tools::Object is a blessed hash ref.

The reason the hash is preferred over the method call
is to support read-only accessors, which will croak
if init() tried to set values with them.

=cut

sub init {
    my $self = shift(@_);
    $self->SUPER::init(@_);
    $self->{debug} ||= $ENV{PERL_DEBUG} || 0;
    return $self;
}

=head2 debug( I<n> )

Get/set the debug value for the object. All objects inherit this attribute.
You can use the C<PERL_DEBUG> env var to set this value as well.

sub _normalize_args {
    my $self  = shift;
    my %args  = @_;
    my $q     = delete $args{query};
    my $debug = delete $args{debug};
    if ( !defined $q ) {
        croak "query required";
    }
    if ( !ref($q) ) {
        require Search::Tools::QueryParser;
        $args{query} = Search::Tools::QueryParser->new(
            debug => $debug,
            map { $_ => delete $args{$_} }
                grep { Search::Tools::QueryParser->can($_) } keys %args
        )->parse($q);
    }
    elsif ( ref($q) eq 'ARRAY' ) {
        carp "query ARRAY ref deprecated as of version 0.24";
        require Search::Tools::QueryParser;
        $args{query} = Search::Tools::QueryParser->new(
            debug => $debug,
            map { $_ => delete $args{$_} }
                grep { Search::Tools::QueryParser->can($_) } keys %args
        )->parse( join( ' ', @$q ) );
    }
    elsif ( blessed($q) and $q->isa('Search::Tools::Query') ) {
        $args{query} = $q;
    }
    else {
        croak
            "query param required to be a scalar string or Search::Tools::Query object";
    }
    $args{debug} = $debug;    # restore so it can be passed on
    return %args;
