You acknowledge that we exercise absolutely no control over such third party content, or sites and in such cases, our network is merely a conduit or means of access and transmission. This includes, but is not limited to, third party content contained on or accessible through the MetroWEB network websites and web pages or sites displayed as search results or contained within a directory of links on the MetroWEB network.
